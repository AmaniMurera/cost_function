## This code snippet demonstrates the training of a TensorFlow model using the Adam optimization algorithm. Let's break it down step by step:

## The libraries numpy and tensorflow are imported.

## A variable w is created using the tf.Variable function. It is initialized to 0 and has a data type of float32. This variable will be updated ## during the training process to optimize the model.

## An optimizer is defined using the Adam optimizer from the tf.keras.optimizers module. The learning rate for the optimizer is set to 0.1.

## The train_step function is defined. This function represents a single training step. Within this function, a gradient tape is created using the tf.GradientTape() context manager. This tape records the operations performed on the variables inside it to calculate the gradients later.

## Inside the gradient tape context, a cost function is defined as cost = w ** 2 - 10 * w + 25. This cost function is a quadratic function.

## The trainable variables, in this case, only w, are specified. These are the variables that will be updated during training.

## The gradients of the cost function with respect to the trainable variables are calculated using the tape.gradient() function. This calculates the gradients using automatic differentiation.

## Finally, the optimizer's apply_gradients() method is used to update the trainable variables (w) based on the calculated gradients. The zip() function is used to pair each gradient with its corresponding trainable variable.

## A loop is set up to perform 1000 training steps. In each iteration, the train_step() function is called, which updates the variables using the optimizer and gradients.

## After the training loop is completed, the value of w is printed. This represents the optimized value of w after training.

## In summary, this code trains a TensorFlow model by performing multiple training steps using the Adam optimizer. The goal is to optimize the value of w by minimizing the cost function defined in the code.
